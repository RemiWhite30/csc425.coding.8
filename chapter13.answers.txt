Question 2:               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7938        1255         217          62        6465        6304
I did not really know much about the normal memory, so I did not have much of an intuition.

Question 4: 
./memory-user 6
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available

This somewhat matched my expectation that as it ran longer there would be less free space. 
The large amounts of memory cause there to be more used space. 

Question 6:
I faced the challenge of not knowing exactly how to add the size of bytes with the linux command, but figured out how to use the argument.
I also struggled a little bit with getting it to stream through the array at first. 

Question 7:
I see different things taking up part of the address space. In addition to the code, heap, and stack, I see vvar, vdso, and vsyscall.

Question 8:
Some of the fields have higher values. It matches my expectation that the size would change with different amounts of used memory, but some of the others were unexpected.
